# playmypy

A mypy demo for python user group.

## What is this?

A good introduction has already been given in the [mypy introduction][3] part
of the documentation.

Type annotations can be used in

* Python 2 with comment-based annotations
* Python 3 with [PEP-484 function annotation syntax][4]

While type annotations are possible in Python 3 and Python 2,
the mypy tool itself is only available for Python 3.3 or later:

    python3 -m pip install mypy
